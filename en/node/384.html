                <p class="int-question-full">One of the main problems that religious organizations face in Georgia is an increasing number of offences/crimes committed on the grounds of religious intolerance and ineffective investigation. In many cases, the investigation is not commenced with respective provisions of criminal code reflecting the motive of religious hatred, investigation process is protracted in time or is not completed at all. What is the position of the party on causes of the problem and how does the party view the solution of the above-mentioned issues?</p>

                                    Party criticized ineffective investigation of crimes committed on the grounds of religious intolerance. According to the party representatives, one of the main problems is the absence of the political will. The law is not enforced regarding those crimes. For example, despite the amendments to the Criminal Code of Georgia, the article 53 determinesthat the violence committed on the grounds of religious and other motives is an aggravating circumstance, this article has never been used by the court. Party pointed out, that in case of their tenure, hate crimes will be severely punished. Applying the criminal law sanctions is not the only way to eliminate the violence, however it is necessary on certain stages. The party representatives provided an example, when the group of extremists breaking into Kavkasia TV station in 2010 were punished for their action (later, they were released due to the status of political prisoners by the current government), the number of instances of violence significantly decreased afterwards. Moreover, it is necessary to implement recommendations proposed by ECRI and hence, to create special unit in the Ministry of Internal Affairs that will be responsible for prevention and investigation of hate crimes, and will be composed with competent policemen.                                </p>

According to the party, one of the motives for establishment of the Agency was to change a form of State's communication with religious organizations since before that, the State used to communicate with religious organizations through security services. The Party representatives noted, that the government’s Human Rights Action Plan determines the activities to be implemented by the Agency in details and they plan a close cooperation in this direction. If religious organizations have critical opinions towards the activities of the Agency, they would discuss this issue in future with them, however, currently they have no answer whether the function of the Agency should change, how it may pursue its work and whether the issue of its abolishment may arise. [Note: representatives of religious organizations strongly criticized the establishment of the Agency and its work.]

                                    According to the party, the State should not issue a construction permit for any building, including houses of worship. Private owners shall agree upon the transfer or sale of property, also, what kind of building is permitted to be constructed. Otherwise, in the process of issuing building permits by local government, the problem of partial treatment will always arise.                                </p>

                                    According to the party representatives, persecution of Muslims in the recent years became systematic and main reason for that is an ineffective investigation of crimes committed on the grounds of religious intolerance. Also, the violence was encouraged by xenophobic statements of the high-ranking officials. As an example of gross violation of Muslims' rights, the party representatives mentioned dismantling the Minaret in the village Chela and nailing a pig's head on the door of the boarding school in Kobuleti. They assessed those facts as "an outmost insult of our culture." According to the party, the State's response to such crimes should be strict.                                </p>

Regarding the construction of a mosque in Batumi, the representatives of the party said that municipalities make decisions on issuance of construction permits in the regions of Georgia. The municipalities are elected by the citizens, therefore, representatives of religious minorities should be politically active so that the government is afraid of losing their votes. Afterwards, such kind of problems are less likely to occur.                                </p>

                                    State funding shall be terminated for all religious organizations. They shall be functioning based on the contributions of their parish.

                                    According to the party, compensation of damages and restitution of the property confiscated during the Soviet times may not be possible for particular reasons.  In some cases, it is impossible or very difficult to find legal successors or define legal connections between entities. Party representatives regard that above-mentioned issue should be resolved not by the government or any other state commission, but the court should deal with the issue of restitution of disputed houses of worship.  The party does not know how the problem of restitution of historically Catholic churches that are already under the ownership of the Georgian Orthodox Church, can be resolved.  As for the possible influence of Georgian Orthodox Church on the court decision because of the State's preferential approach to the dominant group, according to the party, judiciary system should become stronger and more independent.                                 </p>

                                    According to the party, religious neutrality shall be observed at public institutions and generally this principle should be upheld by public servants.  As they pointed put, very often religious symbols are displayed at public institutions; also during the last years public servants were involved in creating obstacles for religious minorities to building their houses of worship. Moreover, local government officials, especially in regions, were involved in conflicts against religious minorities, where they supported the side of the dominant group. There are cases, when they reveal their bias through their xenophobic statements.                                 </p>
